        - introduced new method for computing conservation score for the

        - rewritten Makefile.PL with new prerequisite checking scheme.
        - rewritten interface to _build_query_options().

        - do_attributes() now writes two attribute files: name attribute
          and novel id attribute.
        - Interface redesigned for do_networks() and do_attributes()
          to simplify introduction of new node attribute file
        - sample usage file doNets.pl rewritten to show usage of new interface
          for the two methods

        - changed arguments in compute_multiple_taxa_mean() in doScores.pl
