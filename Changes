0.58	Wed Feb 1 12:28:53 2012
	-get_forward_orthologies(): fixed bug provoking exception when using 'all' DBs
        -get_backward_orthologies(): fixed bug provoking exception when using 'all' DBs

0.57	Tue Nov 1 14:41:07 2011
	-improved documentation
        -setup_ensembl_adaptor(): added support for set_reconnect_when_lost() - introduced in API v64


0.55	Thu Sep 8 15:06:45 2011
	interface changes:
        - get_direct_interactions(): introduced flag to allow for retrieval of chimeric (taxonA != taxonB)
          PPIs if desired
        - do_attributes(): removed label_type flag. Now only "external name" can be used to populate
          name attribute file
        - do_attributes(): introduced 'label_chimeric' to comply with changes in get_direct_interactions().
          Introduced dynamic retrieval of gene_adaptor to find chimeric species and label gene names by
          species name
        bugfixes:
        - _get_interactor_name(): fixed (gene name) problem due to intact change
        - _get_ens_id_from_props(): included 'flybase' case due to intact change in properties field
        - _get_ens_id_from_props(): introduced ensembl ID count: if only 1, accepted, if more, ambiguous case.

0.07  Tue Oct 05 14:50:26 2010
        - rewrote _process_homologies() to get rid of "possible_ortholog"

0.06  Sat Sep 18 19:50:26 2010
        - introduced new method for computing conservation score for the
          putative PPI: compute_conservation_score(). Status is experimental.
        - rewritten doScores.pl to show usage of compute_conservation_score().
        - rewritten Makefile.PL with new prerequisite checking scheme.
        - rewritten interface to _build_query_options().

          and novel id attribute.
        - Interface redesigned for do_networks() and do_attributes()
          to simplify introduction of new node attribute file
        - sample usage file doNets.pl rewritten to show usage of new interface
          for the two methods

0.04  Fri Sep 03 01:09:26 2010
        - removed version bug
        - removed local library requirement in test script

0.03  Thu Sep 02 15:42:09 2010

        - changed arguments in compute_multiple_taxa_mean() in doScores.pl
        - included "usage" conditions in doScores.pl and doNets.pl. No "default" filename anymore:
          ensembl version in filename is dynamic, it would have broken soon.
