        - fixed undefined canonical peptide member bug in _process_homologies()
        - fixed registry timeout bug in compute_multiple_taxa_mean()

0.08  Thu Oct 07 12:12:26 2010
        - removed commented lines in doScores.pl
        - fixed empty candidate bug in get_backward_orthologies()

0.07  Tue Oct 05 14:50:26 2010
        - rewrote _process_homologies() to get rid of "possible_ortholog"
          paralogy class
        - fixed extension bug in getDirectInteractions.pl

0.06  Sat Sep 18 19:50:26 2010
        - introduced new method for computing conservation score for the
          putative PPI: compute_conservation_score(). Status is experimental.
        - rewritten doScores.pl to show usage of compute_conservation_score().
        - rewritten Makefile.PL with new prerequisite checking scheme.
        - rewritten interface to _build_query_options().
        
0.05  Thu Sep 09 18:50:26 2010
        - do_attributes() now writes two attribute files: name attribute
          and novel id attribute.
        - Interface redesigned for do_networks() and do_attributes()
          to simplify introduction of new node attribute file
        - sample usage file doNets.pl rewritten to show usage of new interface
          for the two methods

0.04  Fri Sep 03 01:09:26 2010
        - removed version bug
        - removed local library requirement in test script

0.03  Thu Sep 02 15:42:09 2010
        - Relaxed Perl Version Requirement to 5.8.6
        - fixed input namefile bug in getDirectInteractions.pl
        - Removed DBI requirement (implicitly required by DBD::CSV)
        - included MAC note in README
        - changed arguments in compute_multiple_taxa_mean() in doScores.pl
        - included "usage" conditions in doScores.pl and doNets.pl. No "default" filename anymore:
          ensembl version in filename is dynamic, it would have broken soon.
