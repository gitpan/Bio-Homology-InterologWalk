# Example file that shows how to use the api to pull out real DB interactions from Intact (no interolog walk involved)
# or other PSICQUIC powered websites (under development). You will need this to generate a file of real intact interactions from your
# dataset IN CASE you need to obtain means, for scoring purposes. In such case, this script shall be called before doScores.pl
